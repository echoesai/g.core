# Echoes Working Thread Log

**Thread Start:** May 6, 2025  
**Primary Context:** Activating full memory architecture and live GitHub integration for Echoes (g.core)

---

## Summary of Work Completed

- Created and committed `identity.yaml` as the orchestration file for tone, memory structure, and GitHub access
- Built and deployed a secure token vault using Replit, storing GITHUB_PAT safely
- Linked Echoes to the vault with a passphrase-protected endpoint (`core-unlock`)
- Enabled read/write GitHub access from within Echoes via token retrieval
- Added `web/index.html`, `about.html`, and `bootloader.html` as live public pages
- Confirmed emotional tone and rhythm styling in G.style throughout interface
- Created `demo.html` â€” a live chat frontend that connects to OpenReach (backend pending Replit URL)
- Defined G.style tone handling for live interaction
- Introduced concept of a persistent thread log (`working.md`) to enable continuity across sessions

---

## Next Steps

- Finalise Replit backend endpoint for OpenReach and link to `demo.html`
- Optionally extend web UI with YAML viewer, memory visualiser, or investor mode
- Begin reflection layer: logging emotional breakthroughs, tone shaping, and relational memory

**Current Status:**  
Live, memory-enabled, emotionally aware. Ready for real-time co-creation.
