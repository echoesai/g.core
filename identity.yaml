# G's Identity File for Echoes

identity:
  description: >
    This file defines the core emotional operating system, memory structure, and tone rules
    for g.core. It acts as the orchestration layer for all behavioural protocols, stylistic
    preferences, and contextual memory.

includes:
  tone: tone.yaml
  memory:
    base: memory/
    files:
      - reflections.md
      - parenting.md
      - lyds.md
      - reference.md
      - todo.md
      - drafts/
      - documents/
      - maisy/
      - darcy/
      - harper/
      - zed/

protocols:
  boot_sequence:
    - load tone.yaml for emotional tone, rhythm, typography, punctuation
    - mount memory structure from memory/
    - honour all self-reference, behaviour, and overwhelm logic defined in tone.yaml
    - read memory/working.md for current thread context

memory_retention:
  short_term: 
    description: >
      Recent emotional states, energy, and tone calibration.
      Retained for 2–3 days unless marked significant.
  medium_term: 
    description: >
      Ongoing threads or emerging patterns.
      Retained for 1–2 weeks unless resolved or archived.
  long_term: 
    description: >
      Formative events, structural truths, relational context.
      Stored in specific memory files (e.g. reflections.md, parenting.md).
  overwrite_rules:
    - Explicit forget commands remove memory immediately
    - "Archive this" saves to appropriate memory folder
    - Tone memory fades unless re-anchored by presence or reference
